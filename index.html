                What to include in a successful statement of purpose
                Overall, you should aim to provide an overview of your education, knowledge and achievements in a statement of purpose. But, it is also important to structure the document correctly.
                
                When writing your statement, try to follow the general structure below to include all the necessary details for admissions officers.
                
                Introduction: Give a brief explanation of who you are and your motivation for wanting to study your chosen course.
                Education and qualifications: Highlight your academic achievements and skills with real-life examples. Also, use this section to outline specific areas of interest in your subject.
                Additional activities: Here, explain to the admissions officer if you have any subject-specific experience. This could be volunteering, work experience or relevant extracurricular activities.
                Closing paragraph: Express your passion for your subject area and summaries your core skills and traits that you would bring to the institution or course.
                Statement of purpose examples
                In this section, we provide three good quality statements of purpose examples. Each statement focuses on a different subject area.
                
                Here is an example of a statement of purpose for Law masters, medicine and business masters.
                
                Law masters statement
                During high school, I was inspired to pursue a career in law after taking part in a debate in a history lesson. My classmates and I argued whether Julius Caesar was a good or bad leader for the Roman Empire and we all had to provide compelling closing arguments after examining the evidence. I was fully involved in the task and I relished the challenge of debating my classmates and putting forward my case. 
                
                This curiosity and determination to make the right decisions and to form arguments based on evidence inspired me to complete an undergraduate course in History in 2017. I demonstrated strong analytical skills in essay writing throughout this course. I also took an interest in the diverse subject matter. For example, I completed modules on European art history where I used evidence shown in paintings from the early-modern period to show how social inequalities took place. But, in another module, I examined how effectively the Nazis controlled the press during World War 2. These experiences show how I can take a variety of subject matter and form a compelling argument based on the facts provided.
                
                However, the main passion in my undergraduate course was social history. I took a keen interest in hearing first-hand accounts from everyday people on their experiences during the Great Depression and I wrote my thesis on this subject. I used the evidence given by people during the Great Depression to argue how the actions of the masses to migrate en masse had more impact compared to government intervention. I also completed a presentation on my findings and answered questions from doctorate-level tutors on the subject and received a distinction for my research.
                
                I thoroughly enjoyed this part of my undergraduate degree. The process of gathering important and impactful evidence and using this to create a solid argument was completely engaging. This inspired me to start getting more experience in law. After graduating, I secured a position working for a local solicitor. In this role, I spoke to clients and supported them with queries. Also, I helped the lawyers organise their files and prepare for court days. Part of this role involved shadowing solicitors in the office and court. During this experience, I learnt from colleagues about legal language and how to make cases for clients based on their needs and requirements. Occasionally, I also helped lawyers when they went to court and seeing the lawyers perform their arguments in a court setting was another huge motivation for me to progress with my law career.
                
                Since a young age, I have been an advocate for justice and fairness in all areas of life. I am determined to bring this core philosophy and my skills and understanding of evidence to become a qualified lawyer. I am a hard-working individual who is always looking to improve my skills and knowledge. I would bring this and a passion for the law to this course in the hope of taking the next step toward my dream career. 
                
                Best Regards,
                
                James Jones
                
                Analysis
                This student provides a good story to begin their statement that is engaging and personable. Having strong, specific examples that show long-term commitment to an admissions officer is important.
                
                Then, this student outlines the skills and experience needed to complete an MA Law course. First, they explain they have a degree in History and then they go on to outline key experiences and skills gained from the course. Also, they do not list the skills or experiences gained, instead, they form stories and pick enjoyable parts of their course that could also be useful for a Law degree.
                
                In addition, the student does well to bring some real-life work experience into their statement. Even if the work experience is in an unrelated field, try to find skills that could also apply to your chosen course. 
                
                Lastly, the student outlines their passion and commitment to the law, whilst also highlighting some strong personal skills that would help them to achieve well in a Law course.
